Ridiculous,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id771857507,asst manager rick,4.51.0,3,I had ridden 1 time n still had a 14.99 credit and now it‚Äôs gone ? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è who do I call,9/11/19 02:20
Horrible Payment System,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id408770192,Stephzilla121,4.51.0,1,"First off, I don‚Äôt appreciate having to ‚Äúload‚Äù money onto an app before I start my first ride. ESPECIALLY when I have a $5 credit on my account to start. Second of all, they clearly don‚Äôt care about their customers. I contacted support to remove my credit card because I want to get rid of the app and they still have not contacted me. Even Lime had the decency to contact me after I gave a 4/5 for the experience. In fact, I *highly* recommend Lime over this atrocious lack of good programming. Seriously, everyone needs to get Lime over getting Bird... This bird is flying the coop!",9/10/19 07:26

Good app and scooter but poor customer service,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id200963697,Noonc,4.51.0,3,"Bird has good scooters and a pretty good app. But it‚Äôs annoying that my personal (monthly) rental shuts off in the middle of a ride if it doesn‚Äôt hear from my phone for a bit. Sometimes my phone battery is low so I have to turn it off. Then the scooter abruptly shuts off a few minutes into the ride, sometimes in the middle of an intersection!

As for Bird customer service, they could use some work. When you call they put you in a queue but then after 20 minutes they hang up. On the app-based customer service it‚Äôs hit or miss. Sometimes they respond in a few hours. Other times they take days to respond then close out the ticket if I don‚Äôt respond within a few hours.",9/10/19 02:06

Honestly love the scooters,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id31034467,Chlo-bo,4.50.1,2,I had to open and close and open and close the app for about 5 minutes until it finally let me check out a scooter. Once I got on the scooter it was great and very fast which I loved but I think the app needs a couple updates to work more smoothly.

Map update,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id409997762,"Flap, flap and away",4.50.0,4,The whole app and the way everything is set up down to being able to have a gps that shows the path to your bird is amazing. But if there‚Äôs a way to add in a feature that marks paths to landmarks or points of interest around the area of your scooter would be a really nice feature. Maybe something like adding a voice direction to the scooter to be hands free after marking the destination. That way you get to ride around on the cool scooter and then you can go around and check the local things out in a fast way. Otherwise perfect app.,9/4/19 13:56

Never have I ever had such a difficult time trying to report simple issues because if you lose service your app keeps your tab running and won‚Äôt let you report it after. After, go ahead and try calling, you‚Äôll be on the line forever before you hear from someone and by then it wasn‚Äôt worth your time for the two dollars you overpaid. If this is going to continue to be a problem, I‚Äôll just stop using bird and I‚Äôll start using one of the many other scooter brands out there.",9/4/19 00:41

Bird doesn‚Äôt care about chargers,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id42562188,iiaggo,4.49.0,1,"I have had two weekends in a row not being paid by bird as a charger. Their charger support is slow and largely unavailable during the weekend. When their app doesn‚Äôt work they ask you to submit your charges so they can manually put them in. The problem with this is that they don‚Äôt own up to the issue being their app malfunctioning and they use this opportunity to not pay out what you have spent time and money collecting and charging. Like I said initially, this has happened twice on the weekend.

There is no phone support so you have to wait until they feel like responding. The first weekend they responded the next day and the second weekend they responded quicker but still with no payout after  following their manual submission guidelines. 

I even had a ‚Äúwatcher‚Äù (bird employee)9 help me unload the scooters and he took a photo as well, they still didn‚Äôt put out. 

Beware of these scam artist",9/3/19 16:58

Furthermore, they also need to understand that releasing birds mainly between the hours of 11 pm - 4am exposes chargers to material personal risk in urban areas especially downtown LA. Not all chargers live in Santa monica.

The app is frustrating, it asks me to verify my email almost every day, and sometimes the app is unable to end the ride, and I‚Äôve been charged almost a $1 just waiting for the app to end the ride. The worst offense put me off the app for good, the scooter died as I was going through an intersection, and I had to drag the dead scooter through traffic.

Worst Experience of my life,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id430113098,appDeveloper5454,4.43.0,1,"I never write reviews for things. That I love or hate. But this experience was the worst I have had with any company ever.

Customer Service/Support: 

The bird was 10 days late from arrival. I waited everyday and I got lucky that they only pushed it back 10 days late. My roommates weren‚Äôt so lucky. They waited a month to receive a working one. The ones they received previously were all defective.

I locked up their scooter with their technology. I left it parked for less than 24 hours and when I came back it was gone. I had been riding this thing to and from work for weeks and this was the first time I parked it outside. DO NOT PARK THEM OUTSIDE THEY WILL GET STOLEN. (see technology) 

As many of you know, apps collect data all the time, with every button you click there is data being collected. They were not even interested in helping me find the bird. They literally have all the data. They took 8 hours to reply to me after I said it was stolen. Then took 30 minutes from when I gave a statement to charge me $200 for their technology not working. WHAT IS THIS COMPANY TRYING TO PULL!!! Why should we be punished for their technology not working? Also, if they were really interested in getting their scooter back they would have helped me find it. I didn‚Äôt want to get it stolen, I use it everyday and now I have to find another way to get to work. 

Technology: 

It doesn‚Äôt go very fast and it randomly will beep. My coworkers would get so annoyed when I left it by my desk because it would randomly beep. ‚ÄúI hate that thing‚Äù, my desk neighbor. I think they are all defective in some way shape or form. Sometimes it will be able to accelerate and sometimes it won‚Äôt. There is seriously something wrong with their tech. I was only using it to get to work everyday in a straight path for 10 minutes and although I was scared something was going to happen to it I still did it because it was so short. 

They literally have a small thin cord to ‚Äúlock your scooter‚Äù. This is not safe, they are basically asking to get stolen. It seems like this is to sabotage you into getting it stolen and them making $200 off of you. There tech is so bad I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they are making a profit off of it. 

Also if your phone dies you are basically screwed. Everything is connected to your phone so it won‚Äôt ride or lock when your phone is dead. I had to drag it for a mile to get home when my phone died. It was beeping and resisting the whole time. 

Conclusion 

This experience has been actually traumatic and I don‚Äôt really have heavy feelings toward a lot of things and that is why I am writing this. I hope I can prevent some people from going through this. Do yourself a favor and avoid this app at all costs. As soon as a better product with better customer service comes around these folks are history. Good luckier to them. I am truly embarrassed I ever rode one of these.",7/18/19 17:50

Pricing,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id221946961,Truths96,4.41.0,1,"Our experience: 
1) Does not properly disclose pricing on app. Under payment screen it states...‚Äù$1 to start, $0.15 per minute plus tax‚Äù. Time charge is displayed. There is no disclosure of distance rate or price. Our final charges were $0.27 per minutes not $0.15 per minute, which I find deceiving.   
2) when setting up app, it asks what dollar amount we want to start with. It fails to ask if we, as the customer, agree to the continual charges on card. Or it also fails to disclose to customers that credit card will continually be charged. Currently this option can be unselected under payment tab. 
3) miles are not properly disclosed. There is either a glitch in the system or with the scooters. We were a group of 7 (phones/riders) who followed each other to the same destinations. App showed same destinations with different miles recorded. Again be a glitch or a way to charge customers more on distance.
4) The ride was enjoyably fun! Scooters had speed and the breaking system worked well. No complaints about scooters.",7/7/19 18:42
